        "strengths" : "After going over Git and GitHub with the instructors I feel more comfortable with it than I did after the treehouse course. I feel that I am able to conceptualize most/all of what is being taught, except for the difference between red and green apparently!",
        "weaknesses" : "Styling images! Christ! I'm not sure if it is attempting to mimic another site using their source material or what but I have been struggling with the sizing of images. Page layout is going to be my biggest downfall, or really where I need to spend most of my time practicing. Hoping that utilizing flexbox on my own site will prove more fruitful for my understanding of layout and image/div sizing.",
        "notes" : "It may be, that a better way to size images is by utilizing background-image in CSS. Requires a div to have set width and heigh though."

        "strengths" : "JavaScript logic. I feel relatively comfortable with the concepts of JavaScript that we have learned so far. I think my strengths will primarily lie within the realm of JavaScript over CSS styling. I have felt good about our group communication as well. Everyone is putting the time in and willing to ask questions/help out.",
        "weaknesses" : "More advanced JavaScript. While I just said JavaScript was where my strength lie, it is also where I have plenty of glaring weaknesses. There is a lot to learn and I've only just scratched the tip. Recently I've been frustrated with the .filter() function. I also need to be careful creating infinite loops. Is doesn't happen often but when it does, oh man does it!",
        "notes" : "When fixing an infinite loop, make sure to clear you're browsers cache. Even after fixing the issue and starting a localhost on a different port, depending on where the loop is being loaded it can persist in your cache."

        "weaknesses" : "Knowing when to take a break! I struggled with a loop for an hour and a half, fixed the issue but became frustrated with myself. I then attempted to wrestle with a new concept. BAD IDEA when you're already frustrated. I need to identify when I need to switch gears and work on something else. Part of the issue is that I don't like to leave things unfinished. Probably going to have to learn that this is an inevitability.",
        "notes" : "JavaScript is awesome when it works and you comprehend whats being done. JavaScript SUCKS when you don't."

        "strengths" : "I have become more comfortable with my JavaScript knowledge. Looking at loops and other people's functions has started to feel more intuitive. I am sure right as I say this Zoe & Co. will introduce a new concept that will throw me for a loop....punny!",
        "weaknesses" : "CSS is still a struggle. I understand the concepts, how to write it and many properties, but getting a page to lay out how I want it too is taking more time than it should.",
        "notes" : "It's okay to be bested by the code and ask for help, as long as you've struggled with it for awhile. Your understanding of the material will increase through wrestling with the material even if you need an instructor to make the code run."

        "strengths" : "Holding back shower tears.....just kidding. Things are going pretty well so far. I'm really enjoying everything so far. JavaScript is certainly my strength relative to CSS styling. I enjoy the problem solving and logic of JavaScript. I feel fairly good about my troubleshooting abilities, except for this week when I needed to ask Lauren for help. Didn't know to look for the mistake I was making, makes it hard to resolve huh?!?!",
        "weaknesses" : "Still CSS >.< I am getting a bit better at CSS layout with bootstrap. I have started reading the bootstrap documentation and it has been helping. Another weakness is remember that my XHR request cannot call ES6 functions! Bad ES6, Bad!",

      "strengths" : "Got a positive review from the instructors last week. Was nice to know where the instructors view my progress through the program, instead of my own self deprecating version. I truly enjoy working with JavaScript, I'm excited to dive into C# later on in the program.",
      "weaknesses" : "Had a bit of a freakout with Bootstrap 3 the other day. It was resolved, thankfully. After this event my understand of Bootstrap has increased a fair amount. Styling is still the major challenge for me. I wish we were using Bootstrap 4 at this point. Not utilizing Flexbox's amazingness seems wasteful.",
      "notes" : "Put a bit more time in so that you can ask the instructors for challenges. They expect you to be asking them for more. Push yourself man, don't get complacent."

    "date" : "Date: 4/28/2018",
    "strengths" : "This blog isn't so much a discussion of strengths, more so a reflection of where we are at in the program. We have been learning how to use task runners, specifically grunt. With a task runner come the tasks to run of course. These are a linter with custom rules set by none other than the all powerful Zoe. The second task we are working with is browserify, which to my minimal understanding, allows node like functionality to be used in the browser. I believe this includes things like require, that allow us to make modular file structures. Technically we have been using a third task, 'watch', which tells grunt to watch for a save and then runs the other tasks. I may be blinded by lack of knowledge but this seems a bit redundant/silly. We have to tell a task runner to pay attention to what we are doing so that it will run tasks over and over. Shouldn't that be the default state of a task runner? I realize that using 'watch' may be similar to telling grunt what time of input to look for being it runs the tasks.",
    "weaknesses" : "Remember how last time I said my understand of bootstrap had improved.....yeah....scratch that. Was tasked with making our nav-bar a bit more mobile friendly for our website. Whelp, that didn't happen. You know the feeling when you add 4000000px to your margin and the element doesn't move? It's great.",
    "notes" : "I haven't asked the instructors for personal challenges yet, but our group for chatty has been working hard. We've met every night this week except friday, and we all did stuff for it on friday individually. We've added some additional features to chatty that haven't been given to us by the instructors, not to be rebels but just because we're excited about the project. Today we will tidy up what we have and ask Callan for some stretch goals. Added this so I can push blog 8 branch, will remove this sentence later."

  "strengths" : "Chatty was awesome! This week we were paired with individuals of 'like' skill. This made for a great group dynamic as everyone felt they were able to contribute as much as everyone else. It also allowed us to power through a lot of the material. I really enjoyed working with this group and learned plenty of tricks from everyone.",
  "weaknesses" : "Planning..... We joked as a group that the reason we were all paired, was because we all sucked at planning. Was a struggle to start but once we got going everything went fine. The planning certainly helped in the long run. Have more tickets then not is a good problem to have.",
  "notes" : "All of these group members are great resources and love what they do. Make sure to keep in touch with them."

  "strengths" : "This weeks topic, jQuery. Two words: F#$*ing Awesome! The number of built in methods is awesome. Certainly going to have to take the time to read the material, but the more I use it the better it will become.",
  "weaknesses" : "It does change your way of thinking slightly, mostly due to not knowing as many methods but something to put time into. Learning to primarily target the DOM for data manipulation is a bit different than the JS we were doing earlier. Possible that true data manipulation will be treated with out the sure of jQuery but that is yet to be seen.",
  "notes" : "Read the jQuery Docs. So helpful, even if they don't always seem like it. Better to have recolections of certain methods than to have never heard of them."

  "strengths" : "I enjoy pain.....Just kidding. This week we began to learn about promises. At first it was a bit hard to gather how these functioned. The concept of multiple timelines isn't a difficult one, programmer terms (sync vs async). However, know how the promise is actually accomplishing this is a bit interesting.",
  "weaknesses" : "After bothering Callan for about an hour, I felt quite a bit better about promises. Thinking of promises as executing on a different stream or timeline form the rest of the code was helpful.",
  "notes" : "I would like to read more about Promises, streams, event bubbling, and constructors. Function oriented programming if there is time."
