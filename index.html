        <h5>Strengths:</h5>
        <p>After going over Git and GitHub with the instructors I feel more comfortable with it than I did after the treehouse course.</p>
        <p>I feel that I am able to conceptualize most/all of what is being taught, except for the difference between red and green apparently!</p>

        <h5>Weaknesses:</h5>
        <p>Styling images! Christ! I'm not sure if it is attempting to mimic another site using their source material or what but I have been struggling with the sizing of images.</p>

        <p>Page layout is going to be my biggest downfall, or really where I need to spend most of my time practicing. Hoping that utilizing flexbox on my own site will prove more fruitful for my understanding of layout and image/div sizing.</p>

        <h5>Things I've noticed:</h5>
        <p>It may be, that a better way to size images is by utilizing background-image in CSS. Requires a div to have set width and heigh though.</p>

        </article>
            <h5>Strengths:</h5>
            <p>JavaScript logic. I feel relatively comfortable with the concepts of JavaScript that we have learned so far. I think my strengths will primarily lie within the realm of JavaScript over CSS styling.</p>
            <p>I have felt good about our group communication as well. Everyone is putting the time in and willing to ask questions/help out.</p>
    
            <h5>Weaknesses:</h5>
            <p>More advanced JavaScript. While I just said JavaScript was where my strength lie, it is also where I have plenty of glaring weaknesses. There is a lot to learn and I've only just scratched the tip. Recently I've been frustrated with the .filter() function.</p>
    
            <p>I also need to be careful creating infinite loops. Is doesn't happen often but when it does, oh man does it!</p>
    
            <h5>Things I've noticed:</h5>
            <p>When fixing an infinite loop, make sure to clear you're browsers cache. Even after fixing the issue and starting a localhost on a different port, depending on where the loop is being loaded it can persist in your cache.</p>
