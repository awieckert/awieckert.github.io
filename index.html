        <h5>Strengths:</h5>
        <p>After going over Git and GitHub with the instructors I feel more comfrtable with it than I did after the treehouse course.</p>
        <p>I feel that I am able to conceptualize most/all of what is being taught, except for the difference between red and green aparently!</p>

        <h5>Weaknesses:</h5>
        <p>Styling images! Christ! I'm not sure if it is attempting to mimic another site using their source material or what but I have been struggling with the sizing of images.</p>

        <p>Page layout is going to be my biggest downfall, or really where I need to spend most of my time practicing. Hoping that utilizing flexbox on my own site will prove more fruitful for my understanding of layout and image/div sizing.</p>

        <h5>Things I've noticed:</h5>
        <p>It may be, that a better way to size images is by utilizing background-image in CSS. Requires a div to have set width and heigh though.</p>
